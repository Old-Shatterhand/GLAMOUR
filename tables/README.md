#### Information on Tables

`SMILES_glycans_monomer.txt` and `SMILES_glycans_bond.txt` contain all 946 glycan monomer types with their corresponding SMILES and all 3 glycan bond types with their corresponding SMILES, respectively.

`SMILES_peptides_monomer.txt` and `SMILES_peptides_bond.txt` contain all 461 peptide monomer types with their corresponding SMILES and all 22 peptide bond types with their corresponding SMILES, respectively. 

`glycobase_immuno.txt` and `glycobase_immuno_mini.txt` list the immunogenic glycans, with the `mini` being the dummy dataset accompanying the Tutorial.

`glycobase_taxonomy_multiclass.txt` and `glycobase_taxonomy_multilabel.txt` list the glycans by their taxonomy levels.

`peptides_regression_ecoli.txt`, `peptides_regression_ecoli_mini.txt`, and `peptides_regression_saereus.txt` list the anti-micoribial peptides against the specific microbial species, `ecoli` and `saureus`.
