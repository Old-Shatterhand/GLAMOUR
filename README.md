In this work, we developed a graph representation for macromolecules. Leveraging this representation, we developed methods for - <br>
<ul>
<li><b>Similarity Computation:</b> Using chemical similarity between monomers through cheminformatic fingerprints and exact graph edit distances (GED) or graph kernels to compare topologies, it allows for quantification of the chemical and structural similarity of two arbitrary macromolecule topologies. <br>
<li><b>Unsupervised Learning:</b> Dimensionality reduction of the similarity matrices, followed by coloration using the labels shows distinct regions for different classes of macromolecules. <br>
<li><b>Supervised learning:</b> The representation was coupled to supervised GNN models to learn structure-property relationships in glycans and anti-microbial peptides. <br>
<li><b>Attribution:</b> These methods highlight the regions of the macromolecules and the substructures within the monomers that are most responsible for the predicted properties. <br>
</ul>
